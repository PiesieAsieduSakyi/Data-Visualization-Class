# Data-Visualization-Class
-The data visualization below is an extracted graphic file 
-from a repetoire of Global Climate Change graphics 
-from the Nightingale data visualization website. In particular,
this graphic considers the the estimated average annual temperature
changes for the Gyal Municipality of the Pest region of Hungary
between the years 1960 and 2018.

Scrutinizing this graphic under Tufte's Design Principles,
we first see the Principle of maximizing data-ink ratio demonstrated in 
this visualization. In response to the changing variation of temperature
increases over the review period, it can be seen that the changing 
coloration of the graphic trend assumes varying densities from low to high
as a reflection of the marginal increases in the temperature measures over
time. Thus, the color scale applied to the trend, although visible, is light
between 1975 and 2001 when the region had lower temperatures, but deep
beyond that period when the region experienced higher temperatures. There
was no used ink on the background of the plot where data is absent.

Secondly, the graphic applies Tufte's 6th Principle of Utilizing color
layering as a means to separate/group low temperatures, moderate
temperatures and high temperatures. As can be observed, the color blue
was used for low temperature declines (below 0 degrees celsius); yellow-to-
orange for moderate temperature increases (between 0 and +2 degrees celsius);
and red for high temperature increases (above +2 degrees celsius)
